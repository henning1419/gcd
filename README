## Install 

- ensure `iconv` is installed for unix systems. This is used for encoding 
  conversion of windows supplied csv files to utf-8 

## Usage

For each new Matlab startup:
- navigate to the folder containing this README file, such that the 
  navigation bar contains the correct path. Check by typing `cd` in the 
  command window
- select `setup.m` and run with F9 to add all relevant paths to the matlab 
  search path

## Examples

- Verify that the folder 'example_data' contains just the csv and 
  optionally a results folder
- Select `start_computation.m` and run with F9
- Optionally select and run `start_result_viewer.m` to view results.
  Choose the mat file in the generated lastCalc folder, if asked.
